      "message": "The render function was confused about whether to replace something existing or not. The snackbar was replacing the tip and the second snackbar was replacing the first. Confused me quite a bit.\n\nMaybe I could have made this work somehow, but there were also problems with the `.message\u003d${message}` syntax. Somehow the snackbars did not get a message. No idea why.\n\nAnd then there is some advantage of the content script having no dependency on lit. It also reduces the footprint from 30k to 10k.\n\nAnd the standard `create`+`append` code also fairly straightforward and well understood.",
